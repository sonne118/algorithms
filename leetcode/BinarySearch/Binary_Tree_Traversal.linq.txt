we cross out the left subtree label on vertex B
and move to vertex D

Since 35 is less than 40,


we attempt to
move into node 33’s right subtree.

Let’s walk through it and see where it ends up.

start by looking in its right subtree

The left pointer will point towards the left child of the node and the right pointer 
will point towards the right node
